The draft was considered very large at 150 pages and the pace of browser development, as well as the number of interested parties, had outstripped the resources of the IETF.<ref name="raggett" /> Browser vendors, including Microsoft and Netscape at the time, chose to implement different subsets of HTML 3's draft features as well as to introduce their own extensions to it.<ref name="raggett" /> (See [[browser wars]].) These included extensions to control stylistic aspects of documents, contrary to the "belief [of the academic engineering community] that such things as text color, background texture, font size, and font face were definitely outside the scope of a language when their only intent was to specify how a document would be organized."<ref name="raggett" /> Dave Raggett, who has been a W3C Fellow for many years, has commented for example: "To a certain extent, Microsoft built its business on the Web by extending HTML features."<ref name="raggett" />

; 2011&nbsp;HTML5 – Last Call :
; : On 14 February 2011, the W3C extended the charter of its HTML Working Group with clear milestones for HTML5. In May 2011, the working group advanced HTML5 to "Last Call", an invitation to communities inside and outside W3C to confirm the technical soundness of the specification. The W3C developed a comprehensive test suite to achieve broad interoperability for the full specification by 2014, which was the target date for recommendation.<ref name="w3c2014">{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/2011/02/htmlwg-pr.html|title=W3C Confirms May 2011 for HTML5 Last Call, Targets 2014 for HTML5 Standard|publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]]|access-date=18 February 2011|date=14 February 2011}}</ref> In January 2011, the WHATWG renamed its "HTML5" living standard to "HTML".

; 2012&nbsp;HTML5 – Candidate Recommendation :
; : In July 2012, WHATWG and [[W3C]] decided on a degree of separation. W3C will continue the HTML5 specification work, focusing on a single definitive standard, which is considered a "snapshot" by WHATWG. The WHATWG organization will continue its work with HTML5 as a "Living Standard". The concept of a living standard is that it is never complete and is always being updated and improved.
