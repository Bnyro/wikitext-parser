<big> What is a block? </big>

A block is a measure used to protect Wiktionary from possible improper use or modification in breach of editorial policies. Blocks can apply to a user account, an [[w:IP address|IP address]], or a range of IP addresses that is deemed responsible for or related to problematic activity. You may be an innocent victim of collateral damage, whereby a block of some other activity has accidentally caused your account to be inaccessible.  The reason for your block may be found above.

<big>Most common causes </big>

# '''Problem with your editing or Wiktionary behavior (under any account or IP address)''' - your account or a connected IP has been used in a problematic way or there is a concern about your editing. The reason should be in the box above.
# '''Problem with your username''' - your [[Wiktionary:Usernames and user pages|username]] was unsuitable and has been blocked; you need to choose another before continuing.

* If instructions are given above in the block message, follow them.
* If you have never edited Wiktionary before and/or do not have an account, consider creating one.
* If you wish to appeal the block, or you believe you have been blocked by mistake, please see the following section.

<big> Appealing </big>

The current block will automatically expire $6. You have many routes to appeal the block or its duration. Firstly, if you are a registered user and have a valid e-mail address confirmed, you can contact $1 '''[[{{ns:special}}:Emailuser/$4|via e-mail]]''' (via that link, or by clicking on the "E-mail this user" link to the left of their userpage). This feature can be removed if abused. You should include the following information about your block in all such communication'': <u>Username: $7, IP address: $3, Block ID: $5</u>.

Alternatively, you may appeal the block by requesting that another [[Wiktionary:Administrators|administrator]] review the block. To do so, add
:<tt>{&#123;unblock|''your reason here''&#125;}</tt> to the '''bottom''' of [[{{ns:Special}}:Mytalk|your user talk page]] to request unblocking. You '''must''' state a reason for this, and the block can then be discussed.

If $7 is not blocked, your IP address ($3) or range may have been blocked. Please check  <span class="plainlinks">[{{fullurl:Special:BlockList|ip=$3}} here]</span>. If this is the case, please copy and paste the following text to the '''bottom''' of [[{{ns:Special}}:Mytalk|your user talk page]].

:<tt>{&#123;unblock-ip|1=$3|2=&lt;nowiki&gt;<nowiki>$2</nowiki>&lt;/nowiki&gt;|3=$1&#125;}</tt>

<span style="color:#CC0000;">'''Please note:'''</span> While this block may be upsetting or unexpected, abuse of appeal processes, repeatedly using the unblock template when denied, [[w:Wikipedia:No personal attacks|personal attacks]], or [[w:Wikipedia:Civility|impolite conduct]] may lead to the removal of your ability to edit your talk page.
